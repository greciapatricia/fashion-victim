Are you a Fashion Victim? is a game where you can test how much you know about fashion. ¿Are you a fashion designers freak?, ¿do you know the most famous fashion magazines? or ¿in which cities are the Fashion Weeks celebrated? Play against yourself and discover how much you know about fasion!

## The game
The game starts when you press the button "play". You will have to pass three levels to get your "Fashion Victim Certification". In each level you will have to collect the correct items in order to pass to the next level. If you collect the wrong ones, you will lose 10 points each time and if you reach 0 points you will lose a life. You have three lives to pass the game and if you run out of those three, the game is over.

### How to play

### Level 2: Fashion Magazines
Fashion without Fashion Magazines? Hello? Collect the right fashion magazines and go to the final level! Again, we have chosen 10 fashion magazines that you have to catch but this time you have to catch them faster. Stay alert or Anna Wintour will come after you!

### Level 3: Time to travel!
